 abstract = {In this paper we present FoLiA, a Format for Linguistic Annotation, and conduct a comparative
study with other annotation schemes, including the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF), the
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Text Corpus Format (TCF). An additional point of focus is
the interoperability between FoLiA and metadata standards such as the Component MetaData
Infrastructure (CMDI), as well as data category registries such as ISOcat. The aim of the paper
is to present a clear image of the capabilities of FoLiA and how it relates to other formats. This
should open discussion and aid users in their decision for a particular format.
FoLiA is a practically-oriented XML-based annotation format for the representation of language resources, explicitly supporting a wide variety of annotation types. It introduces a flexible
and uniform paradigm and a representation independent of language or label set. It is designed to
be highly expressive, generic, and formalised, whilst at the same time focussing on being as practical as possible to ease its adoption and implementation. The aspiration is to offer a generic format
for storage, exchange, and machine-processing of linguistically annotated documents, preventing
users as well as software tools from having to cope with a wide variety of different formats, which in
the field regularly causes convertibility issues and proliferation of ad-hoc formats. FoLiA emerged
from such a practical need in the context of Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands and
Flanders. It has been successfully adopted by numerous projects within this community. FoLiA
was developed in a bottom-up fashion, with special emphasis on software libraries and tools to
handle it.}
